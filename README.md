# Stock Data Analysis Using Excel Visual Basic Scripts
An Excel spreadheet containing stock market data will be analyzed using Visual Basic scripts. 

The output will include the name of the stock ticker name and the total stock volume for each stock ticker for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.

This was completed by creating two loops - a loop that looped through each spreadsheet in the workbook and another loop going through every row in each spreadsheet - to find unique stock tickers and iteravely counting the total stock volume for each ticker.
