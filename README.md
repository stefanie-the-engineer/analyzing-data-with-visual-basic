# Stock Data Analysis Using Excel Visual Basic Scripts
An Excel spreadheet containing stock market data will be analyzed using Visual Basic scripts. 

The output will include the name of the stock ticker name and the total stock volume for each stock ticker for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.

This was completed by creating two loops - a loop that looped through each spreadsheet in the workbook and another loop going through every row in each spreadsheet - to find unique stock tickers and iteravely counting the total stock volume for each ticker.

The images are found in the folder Summary and the Visual Basic scripts is included as well. The Excel spreadsheets are too large to be uploaded.

As the Excel spreadsheet is too large to load, below is the link to the spreadsheet containing the solution -
